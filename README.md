## 🌐 The Problem We Solve

The ecological benefits framework offers a standardized way of quantifying and communicating ecological benefits for projects. However, discovering these projects and verifying their benefits remains a challenge.

EBFNT introduces a standard way to connect attestation networks of trust to projects that claim ecological benefits. This makes projects discoverable and their benefits verifiable through an intuitive dashboard, aiding in the evaluation of impact essential for grants programs and funding mechanisms.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Discoverable Network of Trust**: Easily find and connect with ecological projects.
- **Verifiable Ecological Benefits**: Utilize an intuitive dashboard to verify project impacts.
- **Standardized Evaluation**: Facilitate the allocation of capital based on verifiable ecological impact.

## 🚧 Challenges Overcome

- Fixed an issue with the initial Verax subgraph not working on Goerli Linea by obtaining a working subgraph URL from the Linea team.
- Resolved challenges in decoding the attestation payload from the GraphQL API with mentorship and detailed examination of encode and decode examples.
